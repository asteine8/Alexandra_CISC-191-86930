# Requirements
Explains how to extend a class to create an inheritance hierarchy.
Explains the use of the keyword "super".
Explains how to write and utilize abstract classes and methods.
Explains how to write and utilize interfaces.
Explains how dynamic binding enables polymorphism, and why polymorphism is a powerful concept in object oriented programming.

# Outline
- What is Inheritance
  - General Terminology
  - UML Representation
- Implementing Inheritance in Java
  - Example
  - Explain the super keyword in the example
- Polymorphism
  - The ability for objects of a derived class to be treated as objects of a base class
- Polymorphism in Java: Dynamic vs Static Binding
  - Dynamic Binding: set during Runtime
  - Static Binding: set at compile time
- Abstract Classes and Methods
  - No instantiation
  - Implementing abstract methods
- Interfaces
  - No instantiation
  - Implementing interfaces
- Abstract Classes vs Interfaces
  - No multiple inheritance in Java, so using interfaces allows multiple sources
  - Abstract classes allow for more security in some cases and can have variables, constructors, and non-abstract methods
- Show M4 lab as example
