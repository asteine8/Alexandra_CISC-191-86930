# Outline
- What is an array?
- Initializing Arrays in Java
  - Declaring Arrays
    - int myArray[];
    - int[] myArray[];
  - Initializing Arrays
    - int myArray = new int[10];
  - Array Literals in Java
    - {1,2,3,4}
    - {"Hello", "World"}
    - {'m','a','k','i'}
- Interacting with Specific Array elements
  - myArray[3] = 4
  - int temp = myArray[3]
- Arrays of Objects
- Representation of Arrays in Memory in Java
  - Reference to array
    - Reference to array elements
      - data stored in memory
