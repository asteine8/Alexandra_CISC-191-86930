## Presentation Requirements
- Explains how to write and use a class that includes fields (instance variables), constructors, and methods.
- Explains how to write and use two classes that have a HAS-A relationship (object aggregation).
- Explains the interaction of "getter" and "setter" methods with instance variables.
- Explains how to invoke a method on an object.
- Explains the importance of making deep copies of mutable objects.
