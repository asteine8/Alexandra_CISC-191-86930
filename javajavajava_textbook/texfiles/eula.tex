Sun grants you a non-exclusive and non-transferable license for the internal use only of the accompanying software and documentation and anyerror corrections provided by Sun (collectively ``Software''), by the number of users andthe class of computer hardware for which the corresponding fee has been paid. \item  RESTRICTIONS.  Software is confidential and copyrighted. Title to Software and all associated intellectual property rights is retained by Sun and/or itslicensors.  Except as specifically authorized in any Supplemental License Terms, you maynot make copies of Software, other than a single copy of Software for archival purposes. Unless enforcement is prohibited by applicable law, you may not modify, decompile, orreverse engineer Software.  You acknowledge that Software is not designed, licensed orintended for use in the design, construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclearfacility.  Sun disclaims any express or implied warranty of fitness for such uses.  Noright, title or interest in or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name of Sunor its licensors is granted under this Agreement. \item LIMITED WARRANTY.  Sun warrants to you that for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media onwhich Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in materials and workmanshipunder normal use.  Except for the foregoing, Software is provided ``AS IS''.  Yourexclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun'soption to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software. \item  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIEDWARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT AREDISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID. \item  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FORSPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSEDREGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF ORINABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCHDAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you, whether in contract, tort (includingnegligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for Software under thisAgreement.  The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty failsof its essential purpose. \item  Termination.  This Agreement is effective until terminated.  You may terminate this Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of Software.  ThisAgreement will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you fail to comply withany provision of this Agreement.  Upon Termination, you must destroy all copies ofSoftware. \item Export Regulations. All Software and technical data delivered under this Agreement are subject to US export control laws and may be subject to export orimport regulations in other countries.  You agree to comply strictly with all such lawsand regulations and acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain such licensesto export, re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to you. \item   U.S. Government Restricted Rights.  If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor orsubcontractor (at any tier), then the Government's rights in Software and accompanyingdocumentation will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 48CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions). \item  Governing Law.  Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law and controlling U.S. federal law.  No choice of law rules of anyjurisdiction will apply. \item  Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unlessomission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this Agreement willimmediately terminate. \item  Integration.  This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneousoral or written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and prevailsover any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or othercommunication between the parties relating to its subject matter during the term of thisAgreement.  No modification of this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing andsigned by an authorized representative of each party.\end{eulaNL}\secEULAthree{Java$^{\bf TM}$ 2 Software Development Kit (J2SDK), \\Standard Edition, Version 1.3}\noindent SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE TERMS\noindent These supplemental license terms (``Supplemental Terms'') add to or modify the terms of the Binary Code License Agreement (collectively, the``Agreement'').
