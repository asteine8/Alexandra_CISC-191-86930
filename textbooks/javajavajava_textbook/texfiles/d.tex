\noindent The words shown in Table D.1 are reserved for use as Java {\it
keywords} and cannot be used as identifiers.  The keywords {\tt const}
and {\tt goto}, which are C++ keywords, are not actually used in Java.
They were included mainly to enable better error messages to be
generated when they are mistakenly used in a Java program.

The words {\tt true}, {\tt false}, and {\tt null} may look like
keywords but are technically considered {\it literals}. They also
cannot be used as identifiers.
