%% This file is a collection of style definitions written for
%% JJJ 3E by R. Morelli.  They revise definitions inherited 
%% from the 2E compositor.
%%
%% Paul: The idea here was to try and replace commands
%%  that were specifically written for left- and right-hand
%%  pages with a single command that would use a conditional
%%  to format a figure for either type of page.  Similarly
%%  for drop-in boxes, such as JavaRule and JavaTIP. 
%%  Unfortunately, my LaTeX skills being what they are,
%%  these don't work perfectly.  Most drop-in boxes
%%  are correctly placed, but sometimes not.  In those
%%  cases I use the boolean parameter [false] to reverse
%%  the placement.
%%
%%  For figures, I rewrote \figa which is supposed to
%%  place figures correctly (the captions) for LHS or
%%  RHS pages.  I kept the original \figaleft and added
%%  a \figaright to override \figa when it fails.
%%
%% Also, I started using the listings package to
%% display program listings with syntax coloring. This
%% allowed me to get rid of the CDT environments.
%%
%% Hopefully you can clean up the definitions and 
%%  environments left over from 2E, so that when it
%%  comes time to work on 4E, it won't be such a hassle.

%%  each chapter with the command:
